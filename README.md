## User Story 
GIVEN a web application that keeps track of a users income,
WHEN a user inputs the amount they save they will be asked to input the
amount they earned for the week, THEN the user will be asked what their goal for that particular savings is,
THEN the user will click a button that inputs their savings and gives a gif of that goal for savings, in addition, the user may also want to 
use their savings on future investment opportunities, so we will apply a second API called Quandl which has over a million different finaical and econimic
data sets that the user may be provided with.
WHEN a user meets their goal, the user will SAVE their inputs to local storage where it provides possibly a gif + their savings.
WE will use the GIPHY API to intertwine the gifs with our savings goal..
